## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
This game is designed to run on **GitHub Pages**.

1.  **Upload** these files to a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Select the **main** branch and save.
4.  Wait a moment, and your game will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/`.
